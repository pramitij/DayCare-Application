Full Stack Application - Daycare Hub
> Designed a Java Application for Daycare System. The primary aim wasnâ€™t just to craft a solution for daycare management but to gain hands-on experience with full-stack development. We applied the Factory design pattern for the registration system, MVC design pattern for reminder system, and JavaMail API to send email notifications.

## Features

- **Parent-Teacher Communication:** A secure and private channel for updates, sharing milestones, and scheduling meetings.
- **Attendance Tracking:** Effortless check-in and check-out for children, with real-time updates sent to parents.
- **Event Calendar:** Comprehensive scheduling tool for planning and notifying about upcoming events, activities, and closures.
- **Photo and Video Sharing:** A dedicated space for teachers to share moments from the day, allowing parents to feel connected to their child's daily experiences.
- **Health and Safety Updates:** Immediate notifications regarding health checks, meal times, and incident reports.
